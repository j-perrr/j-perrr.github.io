        The Andes region, also known as the "Sierra",is the commanding feature of Peru's territory, reaching heights up to 6,768 meters.
        Hundreds of snow-capped and glaciated mountains and volcanoes tower over the valleys and the altiplano. The Pacific flank of the Andes is extremely dry, supporting only a sparse villages around infrequent wells. 
        On the other hand, the Amazon flanks of the Andes are rain-drenched, supporting exuberant cloud forests, which, because of their isolation and difficult access also are sparsely populated.
        The Andes region is also home to a touristic land site known as Machu Picchu.

        The Andean highlands make up about 34% of Peru's territory, or 437,000km2, but only 4.5% is suitable for agriculture, which still is more than half of the country's productive land. 
        A variety of edible native tubers have developed at altitudes from 2,800 m - 4,000 m, 
        such as some 4,000 varieties of the potato, oca, and olluco, as well as the gluten free grain "quinoa".

            Machu Picchu stands 2,430 m above sea-level, in the middle of a tropical mountain forest, in an extraordinarily beautiful setting. 
            It was probably the most amazing urban creation of the Inca Empire at its height; 
            its giant walls, terraces and ramps seem as if they have been cut naturally in the continuous rock escarpments.
            The natural setting, on the eastern slopes of the Andes, encompasses the upper Amazon basin with its rich diversity of flora and fauna.
